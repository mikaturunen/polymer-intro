# Hands on intro to Docker in under five minutes

Link to the presentation: [Docker intro in < 5min][1].

This is my five minute intro into Docker that I presented internally as a really super-fast ramp up on what Docker is compared to more standard VM environment and how Docker can be leveraged. Heavily depends on discussion with the team and hands-on examples in the slides.

By no means is this a complete "learn how to Docker" type of presentation but a quick dive into the deep end, start doing before even understanding what you're doing. Learn by doing and learn by example are the keywords here.

It quickly mixes the bag up and makes you start using Docker asap, have fun guys :smile:
